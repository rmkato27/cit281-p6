The project focuses on implementing geometric shape classes in JavaScript, including Shape, Rectangle, and Triangle, each with methods to calculate perimeter and area, and utilizing modern JavaScript features like class inheritance,
the reduce method, and Heron's formula for area calculation.

I enjoyed this project as well. I had to work on the logic for the shape functions for a bit longer than other projects, but that made completing the project more satisfying. used the for loop to iterate through the array that we were given. Brought me back to 
CS 212 because we worked so much with arrays in that class, I had a lot of practice using arrays.
